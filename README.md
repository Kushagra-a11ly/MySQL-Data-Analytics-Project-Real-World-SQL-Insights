📌 MySQL Data Analytics Project – Real-World SQL Insights

📊 Project Overview

•	This project is built entirely around real-world SQL analytics using MySQL, demonstrating how structured datasets can be transformed into meaningful business insights. 
•	It replicates industry workflows, including importing data, cleaning it, designing tables, performing exploratory SQL analysis, and developing powerful business-oriented queries.
•	The focus is on uncovering insights related to customer behaviour, product trends, sales performance, marketing effectiveness, and operational patterns, all through MySQL.

📁 Dataset Summary

The dataset contains rich customer-level purchase data, complete with:

•	Customer demographics
•	Product and category details
•	Pricing and discount metrics
•	Promo usage patterns
•	Purchase frequency & historical behaviour
•	Payment and shipping preferences

This dataset is stored as a clean MySQL table, ready for analytics and query execution.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

•	MySQL / MySQL Workbench
•	Advanced SQL (Joins, Aggregations, CTEs, Window Functions)
•	ERD & Schema Design
•	GitHub for documentation and version control
🧵 Project Workflow

1️⃣ Data Import & Setup
•	Designed database schema and table structures
•	Imported CSV data into MySQL
•	Cleaned inconsistent values and standardized categories
•	Renamed columns for readability
•	Formatted dates, numeric fields, and text attributes

2️⃣ SQL Exploratory Analysis
•	Generated summary statistics
•	Checked for missing values, outliers, and duplicates
•	Validated data types, constraints, and field integrity
•	Profiled demographic, transactional, and product variables

3️⃣ Real-World Business Queries
Performed analytical SQL queries covering:
•	Customer segmentation & demographic patterns
•	Product-level and category-level performance
•	Seasonal demand trends
•	Impact of discounts and promo codes
•	Repeat purchase behaviour & loyalty indicators
•	Preferred shipping methods and payment channels
•	High-value customer identification (RFM-style metrics)

4️⃣ Advanced SQL Techniques Applied

•	Window Functions for ranking & retention analysis
•	CTEs for modular query design
•	Subqueries for targeted calculations
•	Self Joins for behavioural comparisons
•	Conditional Aggregations for business KPIs
•	Date & String Functions for feature extraction

📈 Key Results & Insights

•	Discovered high-performing product categories and revenue drivers
•	Identified customer groups contributing the highest purchase value
•	Analyzed promo usage trends and discount effectiveness
•	Mapped repeat buyer behaviour and purchase intervals
•	Derived insights useful for marketing, sales, and supply-chain teams

These insights can directly support business decision-making, optimize strategies, and enhance customer engagement.

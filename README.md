📌 MySQL Data Analytics Project – Real-World SQL Insights

📊 Overview

This project focuses entirely on real-world SQL analytics using MySQL.

It demonstrates how analytical queries can uncover business insights from a structured dataset. The workflow includes loading the dataset into MySQL, cleaning and preparing tables, writing 
analytical queries, and generating insights that reflect real industry use-cases such as sales performance, customer behaviour, product trends, and marketing effectiveness.

📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains customer-level purchase details, product metadata, demographic information, and transaction patterns.

It is stored as a cleaned MySQL table for analysis.

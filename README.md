📌 MySQL Data Analytics Project – Real-World SQL Insights

📊 Project Overview

• This project is built entirely around real-world SQL analytics using MySQL, demonstrating how structured datasets can be transformed into meaningful business insights. 

• It replicates industry workflows, including importing data, cleaning it, designing tables, performing exploratory SQL analysis, and developing powerful business-oriented queries.

• The focus is on uncovering insights related to customer behaviour, product trends, sales performance, marketing effectiveness, and operational patterns, all through MySQL.

📁 Dataset Summary
 
The dataset contains rich customer-level purchase data, complete with:

1.	Customer demographics

2.	Product and category details

3.	Pricing and discount metrics

4.	Promo usage patterns

5.	Purchase frequency & historical behaviour

6.	Payment and shipping preferences

This dataset is stored as a clean MySQL table, ready for analytics and query execution.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

1.	MySQL / MySQL Workbench

2.	Advanced SQL (Joins, Aggregations, CTEs, Window Functions)

3.	ERD & Schema Design

4.	GitHub for documentation and version control

🧵 Project Workflow

1️⃣ Data Import & Setup

1.	Designed database schema and table structures

2.	Imported CSV data into MySQL

3.	Cleaned inconsistent values and standardized categories

4.	Renamed columns for readability

5.	Formatted dates, numeric fields, and text attributes

2️⃣ SQL Exploratory Analysis

1.	Generated summary statistics

2.	Checked for missing values, outliers, and duplicates

3.	Validated data types, constraints, and field integrity

4.	Profiled demographic, transactional, and product variables

3️⃣ Real-World Business Queries

Performed analytical SQL queries covering:

1.	Customer segmentation & demographic patterns

2.	Product-level and category-level performance

3.	Seasonal demand trends

4.	Impact of discounts and promo codes

5.	Repeat purchase behaviour & loyalty indicators

6.	Preferred shipping methods and payment channels

7.	High-value customer identification (RFM-style metrics)

4️⃣ Advanced SQL Techniques Applied

1.	Window Functions for ranking & retention analysis

2.	CTEs for modular query design

3.	Subqueries for targeted calculations

4.	Self Joins for behavioural comparisons

5.	Conditional Aggregations for business KPIs

6.	Date & String Functions for feature extraction

📈 Key Results & Insights

1.	Discovered high-performing product categories and revenue drivers

2.	Identified customer groups contributing the highest purchase value

3.	Analyzed promo usage trends and discount effectiveness

4.	Mapped repeat buyer behaviour and purchase intervals

5.	Derived insights useful for marketing, sales, and supply-chain teams

These insights can directly support business decision-making, optimize strategies, and enhance customer engagement.

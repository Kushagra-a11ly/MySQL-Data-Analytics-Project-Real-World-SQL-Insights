🎧 Spotify Data Analysis Using SQL

📌 Project Overview

This project performs structured SQL-based analysis on a cleaned Spotify dataset. 

It includes basic, intermediate, and advanced query sets aimed at understanding track performance, artist trends, album analytics, and user engagement metrics.

The SQL queries are organized to help learners move from foundational retrieval to analytical functions, window functions, and multi-level aggregations.

📁 Dataset Description

The dataset includes key Spotify-related metrics such as:

Track

Artist

Album & Album Type

Streams, Views, Likes, Comments

Danceability, Energy, Loudness, Valence

Duration (minutes)

Tempo, Liveness

Channel

Most Played On

Official Video Flag

These attributes make the dataset ideal for music trend analysis, artist behavior studies, and performance insights.

🧪 SQL Query Categories

✅ Basic Level Queries

Covers fundamental SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, and DISTINCT operations.

Example topics:

Tracks crossing 1B streams

Artists and their albums

Licensed track insights

Track duration filters

Zero-view or zero-stream tracks

⚙️ Intermediate Level Queries

Focuses on aggregations, subqueries, ordering, and grouping.

Example topics:

Average metrics (danceability, loudness)

Top 5 tracks by energy

Per-album view analytics

Tracks above average duration

Album track-count insights

🚀 Advanced Level Queries

Involves window functions, ranking, NTILE, CTEs, analytics, and comparative metrics.

Example topics:

Top 3 tracks per artist

High-liveness and high-value comparisons

Energy range per album

Running totals of streams

Top 10% and top 5% performance segmentation

BPM deviation analysis
